# Image Classification README

## Overview:
This repository contains code for an image classification task using TensorFlow/Keras. The code includes:

1. **Model Training**: A deep learning model is trained on a dataset of images to classify them into different categories.
2. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. **Visualization**: Confusion matrix and classification report are generated to visualize the model's performance.

## Files:
- **train_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for model training.
- **evaluate_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for model evaluation and visualization.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the code.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/vishal-ravindran/image-classification.git`<br>
`cd image-classification`

2. Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the `train_model.ipynb` notebook to train the image classification model.

4. Run the `evaluate_model.ipynb` notebook to evaluate the trained model and visualize its performance.

## Dataset:
- The dataset used for training and evaluation should be provided separately.
- Ensure that the dataset is organized into appropriate directories, with each class of images stored in its respective folder.

## Dependencies:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
